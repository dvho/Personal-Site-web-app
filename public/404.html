    Because this site is deployed to GitHub Pages, which doesn't support client-side routing, this file is used to handle the anticipated 404 errors thrown when a user tries to access any page that's not the root. This file forces a redirect to index.html, which is the entry  point of the React app, so that react-router-dom can handle the routing on the client side...
