    Because this site is deployed to GitHub Pages, which doesn't support client-side routing, this file is used to handle the anticipated 404 errors thrown when a user tries to access any page that's not the root.  This file forces a redirect to the root path so as to allow react-router-dom to handle routing on the client side...
