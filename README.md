# Personal Website
This is a React app with some of my original piano compositions. It has a contact menu on the left which can be unfurled to view my resume, GitHub and NPM accounts, and to send an email directly from the app.

#### How to Use
Play any of my songs (still works in progress) from the custom audio player or simply click the titles. When clouds pass in front of the moon they dim light entering the room and reveal my animated face, which you can also interact with by mousemove or touch. The visibility of my phantom face is commensurate with the darkness of the room at any given moment. Click the contact menu on the left to send me an email, view my resume, or check out some of my other projects on GitHub and NPM.
